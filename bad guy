a song our teachers sing in the dark


White Shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Failures on both your test for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your exam's F type
Make your recess say goodbye
Might call your parents type
I'm the bad guy, duh

*bad guys music intensifies*






please be cautious, please be kind
You committed, I'm not your crime
Push a button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine
getting fs, so depressed
not passing, im the best
Perfect teaching, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name
By the way
You've been uninvited
'Cause all you say
Are all the same things I did
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have As
ur so stupid, ur so dumb
You're failing, i get paid
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me 'cause you're just a clone
