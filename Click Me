OUR HISTORY CHER IS SO NICE,
NICER THAN ANYONE IN THE WORLD
SHE WOULD GIVE US HOMEWORK, 
THAT WE CAN TOTALLY DO WITH EASE
WE DONT NEED HELP FOR WE NEVER CEASE
SHE IS GREAT WITH HER EXPLANATIONS
THAT SURELY SPARK OUR IMAGINATION
AND IF SOMEONE FINDS OUT I WROTE THIS
I WOULDN'T NEED HELP FOR HISTORY,
BECAUSE THIS WILL BE THE END OF THIS REPOSITORY.




POEM 2:
SCHOOL AS SCARY AS IT CAN BE,
WILL BE SCARIER WHEN A CERTAIN SOMEONE EXISTS,
SOMETIMES I RESIST,
THE TEMPATION TO DESIST
A LIFE OF THE CERTAIN SOMEONE THAT EXISTS
BECAUSE THE CONSEQUENCES THAT ARISE 
FROM MY ACTIONS 
MAY CAUSE  SADNESS
BUT DONT WORRY FOR I WLL END THIS MADNESS
ONCE AND FOR ALL 
BUT DONT DISMISS ME BECAUSE
WE ALL HATE THAT CERTAIN SOMEONE THAT EXISTS.
